Websites I Like:

 * (soundcloud.com) I like SoundCloud because of the comments shown beneath the waveform - They make listening to music a community experience. I tend to spend more time on the website engaged by the comments compared to other music sites like Spotify. The waveforms are also very sexy and allow me to see the structure of the songs.
 * (hugeinc.com) Huge is a creative agency with an awesome portfolio website. The site plays the letter 'H' as a motif to reinforce their branding. The 'H' allows Huge to be creative with their brand while still maintaining consistency.
 * (resume.jonathanravasz.com) Jonathan Ravasz's personal site is an interesting twist on the typical splash page. Rather than being a page, Jonathan's site is 3D room that a user can look around to learn more about him. Considering that Jonathan does work with VR his concept makes sense and is well executed. It also works well on mobile.

A bit about myself:

* My name is Brendan Luu and I'm an Interactive Digital Media student at Drexel University. As a sophomore getting into web development, I am applying the design skills I learned in my foundation year to create compelling experiences. I also enjoy creating 3D animations and traditional art. Living a balanced life is important to me so I eat well, stay active, and maintain my social life in tandem with my school work and side projects.
* I am the founder and president of Drexel University Virtual Reality, a club on campus dedicated to promoting VR technology. I started the club because I'm very enthusiastic about VR and when I was a freshman undergraduate students did not have access to VR hardware. 
* Sports I like to play include basketball, soccer, football, and frisbee. I am a competitive person and I like playing team sports. I am a facilitator. When I'm not playing team sports I bike, skateboard, and lift weights to stay in shape.
* Generally, I enjoy working in teams. Learning by doing and iterating within small teams are the two things I value most in the creative process. Hackathons are one of my favorite things to do and represent my two values very much. I have attended 4 and received 1 grand prize.
