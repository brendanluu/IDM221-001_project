	<h1>Fly like Superman: VR experience</h1>

	<iframe width="680" height="383" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nJmNhq2KN3Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

	<p>At the beginning of this summer, I met with the Child Life staff at St. Christopher‚Äôs Hospital to discuss ways VR could assist their patient care. They proposed a VR game could distract patients from procedures and block vision while doctors administer I.V.‚Äôs or tend to lacerations. Superhero Flight is a first person flight experience I‚Äôm creating to fulfill this purpose. This work was done as part of my 2016 STAR Program and is still a work in progress.</p>

	<p>The hospital staff‚Äôs criteria for the VR experience:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The experience shouldn‚Äôt be too intense ‚Äî engaging but not frightening.</li>
		<li>Children on gurneys are limited to less than 160¬∞ of neck rotation.</li>
		<li>Hospitalized children don‚Äôt always have the ability to use there hands.
</li>
	</ul>

	<p>With this criteria in mind, I began brainstorming games that would be suitable for this circumstance. One game that inspired me was Reveries: Dream Flight, a third person flying game available on the Oculus Store. It‚Äôs fun to play but I wanted to make the flying experience more engaging. I wanted to make a first person POV flight experience where the player‚Äôs head direction dictates where they fly. This was a risk because the first person aspect has the potential to induce VR sickness. However, in designing the game I employed a few techniques to help with comfort. One thing that works well for Reveries: Dream Flight‚Äôs third person flight is the point of reference that the paper airplane provides to the player.</p>

	<p>My first person POV doesn‚Äôt allow the same technique, but I added arms to the player‚Äôs body to act as a frame of reference. This is similar to a lot of the ‚Äúcockpit‚Äù VR experiences out now. In addition, I added particle effects to reinforce the cockpit effect. Out of the 40+ people I‚Äôve tried my demo with, only three people had mild VR sickness.</p>

	<p>This project is the first time I‚Äôve created a Unity game from scratch. While creating it I watched a bunch of tutorials, dissected example projects, and began learning how to logically copy and paste c# scripts/write my own üòÄ</p>

	<p>I showed Superhero Flight to the Child Life staff at St. Christopher‚Äôs Hospital on August 24th. They enjoyed it so much that they are looking to do clinical research with it.</p>

	<h1>Streampunk Room 3D Renders</h1>

	<img src="../steampunk1.png" alt="steampunk1" class="bodyimg">

	<p>I created a steampunk inspired room, lamp, and miscellaneous decor for my CGI II final project. This was a hybrid team/individual based project where my group and I created a collection of objects that I used to decorate my unique, individual space.</p>

	<p>My ‚Äúhero‚Äù piece was an Industrial Steampunk Pressure Lamp. This object was central to my scene because it determined the moonlit lighting style I used to illuminate the room. The lamp also gave me the opportunity to model decaying metal and glass textures that made the object look weathered/realistic.</p>

	<img src="../steampunk2.png" alt="steampunk2" class="bodyimg">

	<p>Some key things I learned with this project:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Maya file referencing working with a team of artists
</li>
		<li>Mudbox texturing workflow with Maya</li>
		<li>Physically Based Rendering (PBR) with V-Ray</li>
		<li>Creating grudge maps with V-Ray</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Special shout outs to Nat Miller, Ryan Mack, and Patrick McHugh for being great teammates and creating awesome assets.</p>
