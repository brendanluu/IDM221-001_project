	At the beginning of this summer, I met with the Child Life staff at St. Christopher’s Hospital to discuss ways VR could assist their patient care. They proposed a VR game could distract patients from procedures and block vision while doctors administer I.V.’s or tend to lacerations. Superhero Flight is a first person flight experience I’m creating to fulfill this purpose. This work was done as part of my 2016 STAR Program and is still a work in progress.q

	I created a steampunk inspired room, lamp, and miscellaneous decor for my CGI II final project. This was a hybrid team/individual based project where my group and I created a collection of objects that I used to decorate my unique, individual space.

	On a whim, I joined Univeristy of Pennsylvania undergraduates Nick Newberg and Kerem Kazan at their school’s game dev hackathon. We created a Leap Motion VR game called ドキドッキ SUPERFUN タイムー GTS98.
