<h3>a bit about myself</h3>
 <ul>
 	<li>

	My name is Brendan Luu and I'm an Interactive Digital Media student at Drexel University. As a sophomore getting into web development, I am applying the design skills I learned in my foundation year to create compelling web experiences. I also enjoy creating 3D animations and traditional art. Living a balanced life is important to me so I eat well, stay active, and maintain my social life along side my school work and side projects.

	I am the founder and president of Drexel University Virtual Reality, a club on campus dedicated to promoting VR technology. I started the club because I'm very enthusiastic about VR and when I was a freshman undergraduate students did not have access to VR hardware.

	Sports I like to play include basketball, soccer, football, and frisbee. I am a competitive person and I like playing team sports. I am a facilitator. When I'm not playing team sports I bike, skateboard, and lift weights to stay in shape.

	Generally, I enjoy working in teams. Learning by doing and iterating within small teams are the two things I value most in the creative process. Hackathons are one of my favorite things to do and represent my two values very much. I have attended 4 and received 1 grand prize.
